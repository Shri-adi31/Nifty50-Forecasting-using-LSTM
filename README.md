# Nifty50-Forecasting-using-LSTM

Nifty50-Forecasting-using-LSTM: This project seamlessly integrates data science and finance, providing valuable insights into market dynamics and showcasing the potential of deep learning for forecasting. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models excel at predicting trends using historical time-series data, and this project demonstrates their capabilities. I utilized the NIFTYBEES ticker from Yahoo Finance, collecting data and storing it in a MongoDB database for querying and in JSON format for model training. Using Google Colab for development and prototyping, I cleaned the data, conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA), and analyzed trends with Simple Moving Average (SMA), MACD, Relative Strength Index (RSI). Visualizations revealed key market patterns. After normalizing the data and creating sequences with a 21-day look-back period, I split it into 80% training and 20% testing sets. The LSTM model, featuring two 64-unit layers followed by dense layers, was trained with early stopping to prevent overfitting, achieving an impressive R score of 0.991. For deployment, I containerized the model using Docker and hosted it on Heroku. I developed a web application with a FastAPI backend and a React frontend, styled with Material-UI, using Recharts for interactive graphs. The full-stack dashboard, deployed on Netlify, enables real-time predictions and dynamic visualizations, offering an intuitive user experience.
